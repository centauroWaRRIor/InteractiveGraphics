# Interactive Graphics
This is a project developed to better understand and explore the theory and practice behind many computer graphics fundamentals. Project was developed entirely in C++ as a rendering pipeline that is implemented completely in software. The only call made to OpenGL is glDrawPixels. However, later in the project, as I started shifting my interests towards writing shaders, extensions were made to accomodate support for GPU acceleration via OpenGL4 and GLSL. __Click on image below to see a demo__.

## Features
__Computer Graphics Basics__
* Vectors, matrices, transformations
* Basic analytical geometry (e.g. points, lines, segments, planes, triangles, intersections)
* Camera models, projection, navigation

__Classic feed-forward rendering__
* Rasterization
* Screen space and model space interpolation
* Basic shading
* Texture mapping, projective texture mapping
* Shadow mapping
* Environment mapping
* GPU programming support

_Disclosure: Project was developed while taking CS 535 Interactive Computer Graphics at Purdue University with the great professor Voicu Popescu. Kudos to him and his class. I now understand the inner workings of graphics API libraries thanks to him. I highly recommend taking his class._
